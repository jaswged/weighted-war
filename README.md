# weighted-war
Strategic war with weighted battles. 

## How it works
Classic war game with a twist!
Player gets a hand of cards to tactically choose which to play. Trying to gauge their opponents. Oh yeah, did I mention you can battle more than one person!

In addition each battle isn't simply fixed based on number, but rather a chance of victory based on how much higher the card is.

Get ready for some weighted war!
